This is Team 810 season experimentation with simulation. 

If you would like to see this in action you will have to download Advantage scope from team 6328. You will then need to copy
the context of the models folder into the advantage scope frcData folder that can be found by opening advantage scope, clicking 
help at the top of the screen and clicking the frc data folder. Then proceed to copy the contents of the models folder into the 
frc data folder. I recommend watching the presentation given at champs buy the programing lead of team 6328 to get a better idea 
of what advantage scope is used for. 

This project is meant to create a stander for how code will be written in the feature in order to make adding things ln the pits and adjusting 
values easy. We are currently investing time into trying to figure out how to properly use all of the simulation tools built into 
advantage kit and built into wpilib. This project already has code for a simulated arm and a simulated swerve drive module. In the future 
I hope to expand the swerve drive module sim class to support different SDS modules but currently the code written is just for the SDS MK3 Slandered 
and this code has the pid controller built into the subsystem, which is not ideal for a simulation class.
